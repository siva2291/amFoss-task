# MY VIEWS ABOUT THE TASKS
The tasks were so tricky than our mains and advanced exams .as i am new to programming without any  single idea about coding and programming.
i have not completed all the tasks but i have did the tasks from which i can be eligible for an interveiw .the tasks were very tough it 
took days and weeks to complete a task for me .by doing these task in a small gap of time i have learned a so many things and by these task we 
can improve our knowledge ,consistency and accuracy also after doing thse task if we complete that and we get solution we get so much 
confidence for next upcoming tasks.
