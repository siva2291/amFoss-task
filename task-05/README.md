this was better easier than compare to task 4 it was also hard 
i have learned about the bugs and other things by references gave by you and youtube and i got some many errors when i was installing dotnet and run it 
it was not happening in ubuntu so i did it in windows .this was my last task which i did it litrally wasted hours on installing dotnet in ubuntu in windows 
it was finished with in an hour.
